Installing Poseidon is very simple. The installation package has integrated the HPU driver for the operating system. We have tested it on ubuntu 18.04. Higher version (i.e. 20.04 and 22.04) also might also work well.

# Install the Package

After youâ€™ve downloaded the installation package, navigate to the download directory and install it using the following command:

**Centos**

```
#install
sudo yum localinstall poseidon-4.0.0-1.el7.x86_64.rpm

#uninstall
sudo rpm -e poseidon-4.0.0-1.el7.x86_64
```

**Ubuntu**
```
#install
sudo apt-get install ./poseidon-4.0.0_x86_64.deb

#uninstall
sudo apt-get remove poseidon
```


The installation process will require the system reboot before it wraps up. The target installation folder for the headers and dynamic library locates at /usr/poseidon. Meanwhile, it constructs a soft link in /usr/local/include for the headers.  

### Example Compile

```
g++ xxx.cpp -o xxx -lposeidon_shared -std=c++17
```

**Done!**

After installation, you can test the library through the examples provided in ["Examples"](https://poseidon-hpu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting_Started/index.html#examples).
